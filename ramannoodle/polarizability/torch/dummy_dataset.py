    Parameters
    ----------
    lattices
        | (â„«) 3D array with shape (S,3,3) where S is the number of samples.
    atomic_numbers
        | List of length S containing lists of length N, where N is the number of atoms.
    positions
        | (fractional) 3D array with shape (S,N,3).
    polarizabilities
        | 3D array with shape (S,3,3).
    scale_mode
        | Supports ``"standard"`` (standard scaling), ``"stddev"`` (division by
        | standard deviation), and ``"none"`` (no scaling).
